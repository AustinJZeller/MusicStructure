# Music Structure
Project from Android Nanodegree by Google

The project just includes the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files.

This is a project done in such a way that it has a structure of a music player app but the important thing to keep in 
mind is that it doesn't implement in terms of functionality. 
But it has all the structure that a music player has. 
So the only work remaining is implementing the functionality
